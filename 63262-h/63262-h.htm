</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meekly he ranged unfettered; his wings were wet with dew,</span>
<span class="i0">And where they trailed in the blossomy grass, a misty rainbow grew,</span>
<span class="i0">Those strong, exultant pinions that trample the windy blue.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then suddenly he raised his head. I felt the pulsing beat</span>
<span class="i0">Of his valiant hoofs. He sprang on the track of the stars, unleashed and fleet.</span>
<span class="i0">I was alone; but deep in the grass was the print of his deathless feet.</span>

<span class="i0">Of sleep. First green, then blue,</span>
<span class="i0">Then the thin water parted, and the sun shone through.</span>
<span class="i0">There lay my body; strangely it was I.</span>
